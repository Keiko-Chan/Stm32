# Stm32
some work with stm32
There is code, I made in 2 sem. It has some problems, which I should fix:
1) delete one en-coder  (done)
2) to do another keyboard (done)
3) add settings before start 
4) add semitones
5) try do two-three sounds in one time (third sw doesnt work)
6) better buttons treatment (done, old errors are eliminated in it) 
7) think about usefulness
